<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the beta of our asset allocation application.</p>
<p>There are two tabs: basket and dashboard.</p>
<p>In basket tab firstly you should build a basket of assets and, then, get the
optimal weights for each assets.</p>
<p>&quot;Add Asset&quot; field is a autocomplete field: if you start to type
some character, it will open a list of products, matching with the string.</p>
<p>You have to select the product and press enter (or click the left button of
the mouse) to insert the product in the basket. The first product of the list is
automatically selected.</p>
<p>You have to insert minimum three assets (and a maximum of ten) to get the
weights of the optimal portfolio. Finally, you could the <b>constraints</b> for
each asset and, after pushing the button &quot;Get Optimal Portfolio&quot;,
please, wait a few seconds to get the result: we should retrieve the
historical prices, create the covariance matrix, set the constraints and
<b>optimize a la Markowitz</b> the asset allocation.</p>
<p>The optimized portfolio is identified with an id: hoovering on id, a tooltip
displays performance, risk (the standard deviation of the portfolio returns) and
return of the portfolio.</p>
<p>The covariance matrix is built using weekly returns since two years before
the reference date.</p>
<p>You can set the annual <b>target return</b>. The default is 0%: it means the
target return is calculated as the mean of the asset returns.</p>
<p>If you (left) click on the symbol of the asset in the basket, you can see the
<b>key statistics</b> and <b>implied volatility</b> graphs for that asset.</p>
<p>If you want to check the figures, you can click on the script icon and an R
script, corresponding to the optimal portfolio, is displayed.
</p>
<p>In dashboard tab there are stats of all portfolios created by the users:
<b>last created</b> portfolios, <b>best/worst performing</b> porfolios,
<b>high/low risk profile</b> portfolios and <b>high/low return profile</b>
portfolios.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask information or send your comments about the first asset
allocation optimization written in javascript:

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>If the result cannot be displayed and you catch an error alert not listed in
the section below, please, retry to get the optimal portfolio. There could be a
network timeout during the dowloading of the historical time series or the
optimization process. If the error is not erratic, please send us by email the
information about the costituents of the basket, reference date and target
return.</p>

<h2>Alert error messages</h2>
<p>&quot;Historical quote data is unavailable: {asset}&quot; - the historical
prices of the asset is not found.</p>
<p>&quot;Historical quote data is unavailable: {asset} ({length}) - {asset}
({length})&quot; - there is a problem with the length of the time series; you
should exclude the shorter asset because the length of the historical prices is
not the same of the other assets.</p>
<p>&quot;constraints are inconsistent, no solution!&quot; - with the given
constraints or target return there is no solution.</p>
<p>&quot;matrix D in quadratic function is not positive definite!&quot; - the
covariance matrix is not positive definite: there is a problem with the return
time series, hence with the historical prices. Maybe there is the same asset
twice.</p>
<p>&quot;{getKeyStatistics or getOptimalPortfolio}: {failed or timed out}&quot;
- there is a network problem.</p>
